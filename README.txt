Fluid simulator.

Controls:

SPACE: pause the sim
R: restart the sim with a resolution of 128x128, (the program launches with a resolution of 256x56)
ENTER: Run 100 tests of simulation speed and save as .csv
Q: The same as enter except way faster and without any visuals
W: The same as Q except it tests simulation speed by varying iterations algortihm instead of resolution

V: toggle velocity vectorfield view
C: toggle Velocity vector length view.
(standard view is colored dye added added to a point)

ESC: exit program

For the quick tests (W & Q), a force shutdown is needed to make the program stop.
It might take a while as well to complete the tests.
When running through processing, there is output to the console explaing how far the tests are.
